        <div class="about-content">
            <p> I am a full-time Biochemistry PhD student at the university of Toronto. Under the 
                supervision of Dr. Grant W. Brown, I am studying how the eukaryotic proteins respond to
                DNA replication stress, a hallmark of cancer cells. Understanding how cells respond to
                DNA replication stress will provide greater understanding of cancer biology and guide
                cancer treatments.

            <h4>Full-time, September 2014 - Current </h4>
            <p> Protein functionality depends on protein concentration and subcellular location.
                My graduate work focuses on global proteomic changes in response
                to DNA replication stress.</p>
